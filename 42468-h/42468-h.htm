took part in the wars they have described."&ndash;<em>The Press.</em></p>

 <p>"We certainly never saw a more damaging exposure, and it is something worth notice that much of it
appeared in 'Blackwood's Magazine' during the lifetime of Lord Macaulay, but he never attempted to

the mere act of following the printer's lines, and leaves the author's mind free to exert its unobstructed

 <p>"Everybody who has failed to read 'Tom Cringle's Log' should do so at once. The 'Quarterly Review'
went so far as to say that the papers composing it, when it first appeared in 'Blackwood,' were
the most brilliant series of the time, and that time one unrivalled for the number of famous magazinists
existing in it. Coleridge says, in his 'Table Talk,' that the 'Log' is most excellent; and these verdicts
have been ratified by generations of men and boys, and by the manifestation of Continental approval
which is shown by repeated translations. The engravings illustrating the present issue are excellent."&ndash;<em>Standard.</em></p>

 <p>"They are noble sermons; and we are not sure but that, with the cultivated reader, they will gain
rather than lose by being read, not heard. There is a thoughtfulness and depth about them which can
hardly be appreciated, unless when they are studied at leisure; and there are so many sentences so felicitously
expressed that we should grudge being hurried away from them by a rapid speaker, without being
allowed to enjoy them a second time."&ndash;<em>Fraser's Magazine.</em></p>

 <p>"On the whole, the intellectual interest of the Count's 'Monks of the West' rests mainly on
this, that it is the work of a brilliant and accomplished layman and man of the world, dealing
with a class of characters who have generally been left to the arid professional handling of ecclesiastical
writers. Montalembert sees their life as a whole, and a human whole; and, with all his
zeal as an amateur hagiographer, he cannot but view them with some of the independence of a
